## 🌟 Project Overview

**TrafficLightRL** leverages **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to dynamically optimize traffic light control systems, reducing urban congestion and improving travel efficiency. This project showcases the power of machine learning in real-world infrastructure management, with a focus on scalability, safety, and adaptability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Key Features

- **Smart Traffic Control:** Adaptive traffic light decisions powered by RL agents.
- **Real-World Simulations:** Authentic intersection models using **SUMO** and **OpenStreetMap**.
- **Custom Reward Functions:** Tailored metrics to balance traffic flow and safety.
- **University-Specific Demos:** Interactive optimizations for Ontario campuses.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations:** Progress tracking with SUMO-GUI simulations.

## 🏆 Project Highlights

- **Innovative RL Integration:** Traffic agents trained to adapt dynamically to changing conditions.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Simulations modeled after real intersections with OSM data.
- **Interactive Demos:** Campus-specific presentations to showcase tailored solutions.
- **Scalable and Generalizable:** A foundation for expanding to diverse urban settings.

## 🎓 CUCAI Demonstrations

After the completion of our MVP, we decided to expand upon the complexity of our project utilizing the OpenStreetMap toolbox! We applied **TrafficLightRL** to various University campuses across Canada to demonstrate how our project might have an impact on real students' lives. This served as our interactive demonstration component when presenting at CUCAI 2025!
