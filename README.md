# ðŸš¦ TrafficLightRL: README

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

**TrafficLightRL** leverages **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to dynamically optimize traffic light control systems, reducing urban congestion and improving travel efficiency. By integrating real-world mapping tools with deep RL models, we develop adaptive signal control strategies that improve traffic flow, reduce emissions, and enhance urban mobility.

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Contributions

Our project applies **OpenStreetMap's Web Wizard** to export real-life geographical locations and train RL agents on real-world traffic data. By targeting intersections in major university campuses, we demonstrate **TrafficLightRLâ€™s** ability to optimize traffic flow in practical, high-traffic areas. Each contributor focused on specific campus intersections, refining reward functions and agent performance for optimal real-world traffic simulations.

## ðŸ”„ Process Flow

To understand how **TrafficLightRL** functions, refer to our process flow diagram below:

This diagram outlines how our RL agent interacts with the environment, collects state information, and learns optimal policies through reinforcement learning.
