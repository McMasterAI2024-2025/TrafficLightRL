## 🌟 Project Overview

**TrafficLightRL** leverages **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to dynamically optimize traffic light control systems, reducing urban congestion and improving travel efficiency. This project showcases the power of machine learning in real-world infrastructure management, with a focus on scalability, safety, and adaptability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Key Features

- **Smart Traffic Control:** Adaptive traffic light decisions powered by RL agents.
- **Real-World Simulations:** Authentic intersection models using **SUMO** and **OpenStreetMap**.
- **Custom Reward Functions:** Tailored metrics to balance traffic flow and safety.
- **University-Specific Demos:** Interactive optimizations for Ontario campuses.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations:** Progress tracking with SUMO-GUI simulations.
